# Sleep Analysis more than 500 days of one person
This project is a part of the Udacity Nanodegree educational program.

## Project Intro

The purpose of this project is analysis the sleep pattern of one person. To find out the effect of lockdown on sleep. Analysis of activity for the period.

## Methods Used

•	Descriptive Statistics \
•	Data Visualization

## Technologies
•	Python

## Project Description

Data collected from a sleep tracker device from one person. The goal is the analysis and understanding the result of the sleep experiment. In this project, I analyze collected data from the sleep tracker and use a simple method and clear visualization to tell a sleep story.

__The key questions:__

•	Does he have enough sleep in general? \
•	How the lockdown influenced his sleep and activity? \
•	Is there a correlation between metrics?

_I use simple stat analysis in this project, but it will be a second part with stat modeling and forecasting._

## Summary
The numbers show that he had enough sleep duration, which equals 7 hours 21 minutes. But after lockdown (25th March 2020), his sleep increased up to 7 hours 31 minutes.

But if we would compare average sleep duration before and after lockdown, then average sleep duration increases from 6 hours 57 minutes up to 7 hours 31 minutes (8.15%).

The interesting thing is that REM sleep increased with the sleep duration after lockdown. However, deep sleep decreased after lockdown.

Here we judge the activity of a person by the number of steps per day. The average daily number of steps is 9463. Before lockdown, the average number was 8151 steps. But after the lockdown, the average number of steps increased up to 10029.

The most active day is Sunday. That might be connected to the person's extended sleep on Sunday. But the correlation between sleep duration and steps is 0.18, which is not significant.
